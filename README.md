## General comments on programming

we're all piecemeal in our knowledge because this is not our job. that's
good. recognize it, that it means within a short amount of time of starting
you will know things that others (more experienced) will not, and that in
reverse people who overall know much less than you will know more about
some aspects. = don't be arrogant, help one another.

i only know things piecemeal because i never really made computers my
job. you'll be piecemeal too. it means you'll always have holes, people
will always know more than you do. and it means you'll complement others &
vice versa. be humble, be useful.

information processing is fundamental. evolution shapes us to efficiently
process information. now we've reached the point where a species can build
machines that simulate other machines (programs) to process information
however we like. quite extraordinary.  working with information is somehow
so fundamental.  it's like math, only even more general.

you get a tool that you can use to make other tools.

cynical about everything, idealistic about programming.

almost all programs start & grow in the same way. from something very
simple. from an itch. they always look complex when you arrive late, after
many incremental rounds of dev.

i have to look things up all the time

all programming languages are (more or less) the same.

### Programming is really pretty simple

it's all just common sense. think about how you would do something in the
real world, then do that in the computer.

things that make programming seem hard are: weird names, weird details,
frozen accidents.

programming stuff is dressed up to look harder than it is. people with
knowledge protecting their position. but not all.

very few control flow things (if/then/else, loop). very few data structures.


## Description of course, aims, beliefs, etc.

broad range of students in the class. help each other. many of you came at
this with no background & taught yourselves (e.g., sam, eppie). be
generous.  close the gaps.

solve problems just over the horizon of what you can do without programming

this is a course for the beginners. if you're not a beginner, you're expected to help.

it's great to know nothing and to have no background. there is no stronger position.

let's have an appointed village idiot in each class. ask all possible questions.

let's have a note taker in each class. take notes in markdown, push them into github.

make yourselves into a little community. self support, teach, etc.

## Course aims

make you programmers

get you using the shell (somewhat) efficiently

show you how to help yourselves

show you what's possible - breadth not depth. there are lots of moving parts to understand.

the idea is to get you programming and then give a broad sweep of what's possible.

## Topics

### Python

classes

control flow

data structures - scalars, lists, tuples, dicts

reading CSV

reading FASTA

jupyter notebooks

### The shell

is a language, just like python is a language can be used interactively or
via commands in a file shell programming - shell loops, shell
metacharacters there's a LOT you can do in the shell

the shell is extremely powerful, allowing you to do all sorts of things to
data with (real) programming.  it is a programming language too.

shell tools:  awk, sed, perl, tr, grep, cut, echo, test, make, less, cat, parallel.

redirection: `|`, `<`, `>`, stdin, stdout, stderr.

also: let the filesystem do (some of) the work

### Testing

difference between scripts and libraries.  this split is good for testing.

### Version control

git
github

### Miscellaneous

something about markdown

online notebooks with pelican

plotting with matplotlib, plotly, other?

other python modules
