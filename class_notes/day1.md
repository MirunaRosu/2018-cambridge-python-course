Terry's intro
-------------
It's good to know nothing. We all know very little. Terry knows very little.


Setting up
----------

Homebrew - a package manager. It makes installing command line programs (programs without an application icon) simple. It keeps a repository of all the most used programs so you can download them easily.

Sublime text - a text editor. You can also use others but this has handy features like code highlighting and autocompletion for different languages.
