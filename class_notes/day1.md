Day 1
=====


Terry's intro
-------------
It's good to know nothing. We all know very little. Terry knows very little.


Setting up
----------

Homebrew - a package manager. It makes installing command line programs (programs without an application icon) simple. It keeps a repository of all the most used programs so you can download them easily.

Sublime text - a text editor. You can also use others but this has handy features like code highlighting and autocompletion for different languages.


The directory tree
------------------

All the files are stored somewhere in a directory. The desktop is no different, it's just a special folder where all the contents are shown as icons on the desktop.


The shell
---------

Multiple shells, BASH is the most common - "Bourne Again SHell"

You can enter different shells (Control-D to exit a shell)

Control-L to empty the shell screen.


Command list
============
